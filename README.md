# Behind-The-Silicon-Veil
A 2D platformer game made using Unity. Coded in C# and solo developed by me.

This project started as a much smaller project called "Under the Veil". It didn't amount to much as was purely a way to learn and refine my coding ability in C#.

"Under the Veil" is a small test project that features a main character with two equipable abilities: A laser gun and a dash ability. The laser gun fired projectile objects that damaged moving enemies when they collided. The dash ability allowed the player to get out of sticky situations, but with a drawback of having a 3 second cooldown timer.

These different abilities tested my coding ability and breadth. With this more refined project that I am creating, these abilities will return along with a plethera of new abilities.
I am aiming to complete all of the code, game art and audio design as a solo project. I am excited to see the progress of this game.
